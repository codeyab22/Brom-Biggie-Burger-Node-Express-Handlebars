# Eat-Da-Brom-Biggie-Burger-Node-Express-Handlebars

# About the Project 
This is the 12th project. THis Eat-Da-Brom-Biggie-Burger-Node-Express-Handlebars is for the all vegan (everything you restaurant app that gives burgers a rennovation for the quarantine. It allows the users to give their burgers options through their inputs. Connecting the heroku app to Github, it activates the deployed website.

# User's Story
This is for a person that is hungry and consistently works/stays at home. This is good time for his/her lunch break. This is a perfect food online 
for a user who don't want to be in the line for his/her order. 

# Motivation(s)
My motivation is to experiment with SQL and take a good look at the list of the menu order to gives users pretty cool options.
My motivation is to give user to pick their tastes of the burgers and  choose their favorites.
